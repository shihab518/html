<p class="a"><b>The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB)</b> is pleased to announce that allrounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz has been appointed as the captain of the Bangladesh One Day International team for the next 12 months.<br>

 Miraz, 27, will take over from Najmul Hossain Shanto and begin his full-time captaincy tenure with the upcoming three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka next month. He has previously led the national side in four ODIs in Shanto’s absence.<br>

 Chairman of BCB’s Cricket Operations Committee Nazmul Abedeen said: “The Board felt that Miraz’s consistent performances with the bat and ball, his ability to fight and inspire the team and his energetic presence on and off the field, make him an ideal candidate to lead the ODI side during a transitional time. We believe he has the temperament and maturity to take Bangladesh forward in this format.<br>
</p>
<p class="b">We take this opportunity to thank Shanto for the positivity and character he has demonstrated as captain. He remains very much a part of the leadership group and we know how important his batting is to the team.”<br>

 With 1617 runs and 110 wickets in 105 ODIs, Miraz is currently ranked number four among allrounders in the ICC ODI rankings, the highest for any Bangladeshi player. He joins an elite group of Bangladeshi cricketers, that includes Mohammad Rafique, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Shakib Al Hasan, to have achieved the 1000 runs and 100 wickets double in ODIs.<br>

 Reacting to his appointment, Miraz said: “It is a huge honour for me to be entrusted with this responsibility by the Board. Leading the country is a dream for any cricketer and I am grateful for the confidence the Board has shown in me.<br>

 “I have every faith in this team. We have the talent and the belief to play fearless cricket. I want us to perform with confidence, play without inhibition and continue giving our best for the country.</p>
